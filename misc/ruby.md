## Single Ruby Command

    ruby -e 'puts 123'

* `puts` - prints a value and appends a newline to the end
* `print`- prints a value and DOESN'T append a newline to the end


## IRB - Interactive Ruby Shell

`irb` - to begin

## Nil

`nil` is essentially `null`. You can test if a value is `nil` with `?`

    x = nil
    x.nil?              # true

## Ruby Information - Docs

`ri` is almost like using `man` in Unix. It stands for Ruby Information. 

e.g. `ri upcase`

## Ruby Objects

There are no real primitives. Primitives don't have a common relationship to each other. In Ruby, everything is an object. 

## Variables Scoping

    $var            # Global
    @@var           # Class
    @var            # Instance
    var             # Local
    var             # Block

## The `class` method

You can see the class that an object belongs to by using the `class` keyword.

    1234.class          # Fixnum
    12489010941.class   # Bignum
    '1234'.class        # String

## Number methods

* `round` - rounds up
* `to_i` - casts as int
* `floor` - rounds down
* `ceil` - similar to round

## String interpolation and methods

Only works with double quotes.

    a = 5
    puts "value of a is #{a}"
    puts "#{5 + 5}"

* `reverse`
* `capitalize` 
* `upcase` 
* `downcase` 
* `length`
* `to_s` â€“ cast as String

Can use chaining

    "Hello".reverse.upcase.length

## Arrays

    arr = [1, 2, 3]
    arr[1]                  # 2
    arr << 4                # 1, 2, 3, 4
    arr.clear               # []
    arr.inspect             # "[1, 2, 3, 4]"
    puts arr.inspect        # [1, 2, 3, 4]
    arr.to_s                # "[1, 2, 3, 4]"
    arr.join                # "1234"
    arr.join(', ')          # "1, 2, 3, 4"
    "1,2,3,4".split(',')    # [1, 2, 3, 4]
    arr.reverse             # [4, 3, 2, 1]
    arr.sort                # [1, 2, 3, 4]

    arr2 = [1, 2, 2]        
    arr2.uniq               # [1, 2]
    arr2.insepct            # [1, 2, 2]
    arr2.uniq!              # [1, 2]
    arr2.inspect            # [1, 2]
    
    arr3 = [3, 4, 5, 6]
    arr3.delete_at(1)       # [3, 5, 6] - returns deleted index
    arr3.delete(5)          # [3, 6] - searches array for term, not index!
    arr3.push(7)            # [3, 6, 7] - adds to end of array. Same as <<
    arr3.pop                # [3, 6] - removes and returns last index
    arr3.shift              # [6] - removes and returns first index
    arr3.unshift(2)         # [2, 6] - adds to beginning of array
    arr3 + [8, 9]           # [2, 6, 8, 9]
    arr3 - [8, 9]           # [2, 6]
    arr3 - [6]              # [2] same as delete

## Hashes

Unordered, object-indexed collection of objects, aka key-value pairs. We can never count on a hash being in any particular order.

    person = {'name' => 'ben', 'age' => 37}
    person['name']          # ben
    person.index('ben')     # name
    person.keys             # name, age
    person.values           # ben, 37
    person.length           # 2
    person.size             # 2
    person.to_a             # [["name", "ben"], ["age", 37]] changes to array
    person.clear            # {}
    person = {}

## Symbols

A symbol is a label that is used to identify a piece of data.

    :someSymbol                     # declares a symbol

A symbol gets stored in memory one time, whereas a string gets stored in memory many times. Below you can see that a new object is not created for symbol, but it is for string.

    "test".object_id                # id-1
    "test".object_id                # id-2
    :symbl.object_id                # id-3
    :symbl.object_id                # id-3

Symbols are designed to be used in hashes, because they **conserve memory**. So if you are looping and creating 10 new Person objects, and each of them has a key labelled "name", then if you use a String, 10 places will be created in memory, but if you use a Symbol, then only one place will be created in memory, and it will be reused 10 times.

## Boolean Methods

    x = 5 
    x.nil?                          # false
    x.between?(2, 6)                # true
    y = [1, 2, 3]
    y.empty?                        # false
    y.include?(3)                   # true
    z = {:a => 1, 'b' => 2}
    z.has_key?(:a)                  # true
    z.has_value(2)                  # true

## Ranges

Ranges are a run of numbers from start to end.

    1..4                # Inclusive - 1, 2, 3, 4
    1...4               # Exclusinve - 1, 2, 3
    1..10.class         # Error
    (1..10).class       # Works! Range
    x = 1..5
    x.first             # 1
    x.begin             # 1
    x.last              # 5
    x.end               # 5
    y = [*x]            # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Be careful with exclusive Ranges. Here's why:

    x = 1...4
    x.end               # 4
    x.include?(4)       # false
    x.include?(3)       # true

You can also create alphabetic ranges:

    alpha = a..d        
    z = [*alpha]        # a, b, c, d

## Constants

Constants are similar to variables in that they are not true objects, but they do point to objects.

Declare constants with full upper case, or with an upper case first letter

    TEST = 5
    Name = 'Ben'

That said, if you perform an assignment on them, Ruby will issue a warning, but it WILL perform the assignment

    TEST = 6        # Warning
    TEST            # 6

## Conditionals

    if boolean
        ...
    end

    if boolean
        ...
    elsif boolean
        ...
    else 
        ...
    end

Tabs are not used by Ruby. They're just there for our benefit. 

You can also have a one liner

    x = true
    puts 'hello' if x           # hello

### Unless

Unless is the same as `if !boolean`

    unless boolean
        ...
    elsif boolean
        ...
    end

### Case

    case
    when boolean
        ...
    when boolean
        ...
    else 
        ...
    end

Or you can use the following syntax

    case test_value
    when value
        ...
    when value
        ...
    else
        ...
    end

### Ternary

    boolean ? code1 : code2

    puts x ==1 ? 'one' : 'not one'

## Or

Same as Javascript

    x = y || z

If `y` doesn't exist, default to `z`

## Xor

unless x already has a value, set it to y

    unless x
        x = y
    end

    x || = y

## Loops

Same as a while loop.,

    loop do
        ...
    end

We use the following to control the loop
    
    * break - Terminate the whole loop
    * next - Jump to next iteration of the loop
    * redo - Restart this loop
    * retry - Start the whole loop over

e.g.
    
    x = 0
    loop do
        x += 2
        break if x > 6
        puts x
    end
    
    # 2, 4, 6

### While

This simply has the break condition built into it. 

    while boolean
        ...
    end

### Until

until = While it is not true

    until boolean
        ...
    end

You can also use these in one liners

    x = 0
    puts x+=2 while x < 10
    puts x+=2 until x > 20

## Iterators

Iterators are similar to loops, except that they traverse a fixed set of data. We know where the starting point and ending point is. An iterator says "For each one of these things, do this process".

Similar to map, forEach in JS.

Instead of writing

    x = 0
    while x < 5
        x ++
        puts 'Hello'
    end

We can use:

    5.times do
        puts "Hello"
    end

    1.upto(5) {puts 'Hi'}
    5.downto(1) {puts 'Hi'}
    (1..5).each {puts 'Hi'}

We also have access to the value

    1.upto(5) do |i|
        puts "Hello" + i.to_s
    end

We can also use `for`, which is the same as an `each`

    veggies = ['brocolli', 'carrot', 'yam']
    for veg in veggies
        puts veg.capitalize
    end
    
    # Brocolli, Carrot', Yam

We can still use `break`, `next`, `redo`, and `retry` with Iterators. Although `redo` and `retry` are more useful.

`retry` says go back to the beginning of the set

### List of Iterators

* Ints/floats - times, upto, downto, step
* Range - each, step
* String - each, each_line, each_byte
* Array - each, each_index, each_with_index (each item with its index)
* Hash - each, each_key, each_value, each_pair

## Code Blocks

The most common code block methods are:

If you use `!` with any of these, they update the values in-place. e.g. `merge!`

* `find`
* `merge`
* `collect`
* `sort`
* `inject`

### Find

We use various find methods to find objects inside a dataset.

* `find/detect`
* `find_all/select`
* `any?`
* `all?`
* `delete_if` - find something, and then delete it, all in one step

E.g's:

    (1..10).find {|i| i == 5}           # 5
    (1..10).find {|i| i % 3 == 0}       # 3 Only returns first instance of
    (1..10).detect {|i| i == 5}         # 5
    (1..10).detect {|i| i % 3 == 0}     # 3 Only returns first instance of
    (1..10).find_all {|i| i % 3 == 0}   # 3, 6, 9 Returns all instances of
    (1..10).select {|i| i % 3 == 0}     # 3, 6, 9 Returns all instances of    
    (1..10).any? {|i| i % 3 == 0}       # true. returns true if is true  
                                        # for ANY inside the set
    (1..10).all? {|i| i % 3 == 0}       # false. returns true if is true  
                                        # for ALL inside the set
    [*1..10].delete_if {|i| i % 3 == 0}         # same as filter in Javascript

### Merge

Is used for merging Hashes together. ONLY used with Hashes. Merge does not change original values, unles you use `!`. If you use `.merge!`, original values get overwritten.

    h1 = {'a' => 1, 'b' => 555}
    h2 = {'b' => 2, 'c' => 3}
    h1.merge(h2)                    # {"a"=>1, "b"=>2, "c"=>3}

Above we've used it just as a one-liner. If we define a code block, that will only be called if there is a conflict - e.g. `b`

    h1.merge(h2) {|key, old, new| old}          # old value gets used
    h1.merge(h2) {|key, old, new| new}          # new value gets used
    h1.merge(h2) {|key, old, new| new * 2}      # new value gets used

    h1.merge(h2) do |k, o, n|
        if old < new
            old
        else
            new
        end
    end

although we could write this as

    h1.merge(h2) {|k, o, n| o < n ? o : n}


### Collect / Map

Collect and Map are exactly the same. Multiple names for the same thing. Yuchk...

Works with `arrays`, `hashes`, and `ranges`.

Works the same as Javascript `map`, except that you have to specify the return value for non matches. E.g.

    arr = ['a', 'b', 'c']
    arr.map {|val| val.capitalize if val == 'b'}
    # returns [nil, 'B', nil] - not what you'd expect, right?

    arr.map {|val| val == 'b' ? val.capitalize : val}


RULE 1: Number of items in = number of items out
RULE 2: Even though it works with Hashes and Ranges, it **always** outputs an array

NOTE: If you use `puts` in a Collect/Map, then the return array will be filled with `nils`, because `puts` always returns `nil`.

### Sort

With sorts, we use the comparison operator `<=>`. This allows us to compare two values. 

    a <=> b
    1 <=> 2                 # -1    

Returns -1 if   `a` < `b`
Returns 0 if    `a` = `b`
Returns 1 if    `a` > `b`

When used with `sort`,

Move left if        `a` < `b`
Stay in place if    `a` = `b`
Move right if       `a` > `b`

    arr = [3, 5, 2, 1]
    arr.sort {|v1, v2| v1 <=> v2}       # 1, 2, 3, 5
    arr.sort                            # 1, 2, 3, 5
    arr.sort {|v1, v2| v2 <=> v1}       # 5, 3, 2, 1
    arr.sort.reverse                    # 5, 3, 2, 1

If we just want to sort by one measurement, we can use `sort_by`

    arr = ['cayla', 'daniel', 'adam', 'ben']
    arr.sort_by {|name| name.length}    # ["ben", "adam", "cayla", "daniel"]

You can sort hashes, but Ruby turns them into an array.

    hash = {'a': 5, 'b': 3, 'c': 1}
    hash.sort {|v1, v2| v1[1] <=> v2[1]}
    # [[:c, 1], [:b, 3], [:a, 5]]

### Inject (Accumulator)

Similar to Javascripts Reduce method.

By convention, the variable that holds the accumulated value is called `memo`.

    (1..10).inject{|memo, n| memo + n}            # 55
    (1..10).inject(100){|memo, n| memo + n}       # 155 init val of memo is 100

Be careful about the return value of `memo` though. E.g.

    (1..10).inject{|memo| memo * n if n != 3}     # Error!

When `n` hits 3, then the entire code block is invalidated and does not run, so `nil` is returned. Then on the next iterateion, `memo` is `nil` and Ruby tries to multiply it by the next value in the Range, which generates and error.

`puts` also returns `nil`, so be careful.

    (1..10).inject{|memo| puts memo + n; memo}     

This says the final value should be `memo`. It's the only time you get to use semicolon.

## Defining and Calling Methods

In other languages, these are called `functions`, but in Ruby, they're called `methods`.

    def some_name
        puts 'Hello there'
    end
    
    some_name                   # Hello there

### Modules

Import a file with `require`. You can `require` a file in `irb`.

### Return Values

In a method code block, Ruby uses the last line of code as the return value. But we can also use the `return` keywords.

All methods have a return value, even if its just `nil`.

## Classes

Class name are upper camelCase.

    class SomeName
        ...
    end

full e.g.

    class Person
      def yell
        return "Hey!"
      end
    end
    
    ben = Person.new
    puts ben.yell.downcase

### Attributes

Attributes are values that will persist inside of an instance.

We use instance variables `@instance_var` as attributes inside of classes.

You never have access to instance variables outside of the class. The class methods have access to them, but outside, we don't.

    class Person
      def set_noise
        @noise = 'yell'
      end
    
      def yell
        @noise
      end
    end
    
    ben = Person.new
    puts ben.yell

Even though `@noise` is set inside of another method, it has global scope.

### Reader/Writer Methods

This is Ruby's naming take on getter/setters.

    class Animal
        def noise=(noise)
            @noise = noise
        end
    
        def noise
            @noise
        end
    end
    
    cow = Animal.new
    cow.noise = "Moo!"
    puts cow.noise                    # Moo!

Ruby figures out by the arguments which one is which.

### Attribute Methods

If you have a large class with lots of attributes, you can use the Attribute methods that Ruby provides to more efficiently set and get attribute values. 

* `attr_reader` - creates a reader method
* `attr_writer` - creates a writer method
* `attr_accessor` - creates both a reader and a writer method

The following are the same:

    attr_writer :name
    
    def name
        @name
    end

    attr_writer :name
    
    def name=(value)
        @name = value
    end

    attr_accessor :name 
    def name
        @name
    end
    
    def name=(value)
        @name = value
    end

You can use these to create getter and setter methods for multiple attributes by separating attribute names with commas. E.g.

    attr_accessor :name, :age, :weight

Full example

    class Animal
        attr_accessor :name
        attr_reader :age
        attr_writer :opinion
    end
    cow = Animal.new
    cow.opinion = "Moo"

### Initialize

Use the initialize function name as a constructor in Ruby

    class Animal
        def initialize(val1, val2)
            @val1 = val1
            @val2 = val2
        end
    end
    
    cow = Animal.new('bovine', 555)

### Class Methods

A class method is a method that can be called on the class, even without an instance of the class. 

We can call methods directly on the class.

An example of a class method is `cow = Animal.new`. Even though there is not yet an instance, we can call `new`.

    class Animal
        def self.talk
            puts 'Hello'
        end
    end
    
    cow = Animal.talk

### Class Attributes

Class attributes store values that apply to the class generally.
    
    class Animal
        @@species = 'bovine'
    
        def self.talk
          puts "Hello #{@@species}"
        end
    end
    
    cow = Animal.talk

### Overloading Methods

Ruby will know which method you want to use based on there being or not being params.

    class Animal
        def self.species
          @@species
        end
    
        def self.species(arg='')
          @@species = arg
        end
    end
    
    Animal.species('froggy')
    puts Animal.species

### Inheritance

Bestowal of methods and attributes of another class.

Ruby terminology is to call the Parent the Superclass and to call the Child the Subclass.

To make a class a Subclass - so that it inherits the variables and methods of another class, use the `<` sign.

In Ruby, we can inherit from **one and only one** Superclass. That means that we do NOT have multiple inheritance.

    class Animal
        ...
    end
    
    class Cow < Animal
        ...
    end

### Subclass overwriting

You can overwrite methods in the Parent class just be redefining them in the Child as long as they have the same name. You can also do this for the core Ruby language:

    class Array
        def to_s
            self.join(', ') 
        end
    end

### Super

Super is a method that calls the function of the same name in the Parent Class.

    class Animal
        def self.eat
          puts 'Lets eat'
        end
    end
    
    class Cow < Animal
        def self.eat
          super
          puts 'Lets eat again' 
        end
    end
    
    Cow.eat

## Modules

Modules are wrappers around Ruby code, but that CAN'T be instantiated. You can never have an instance of a module. Instead, we use Modules in conjunction with our classes.

### Namespaces

Namespacing allows us to have class names that don't conflict. 

We use Modules to namespace Ruby classes to ensure there is no naming conflict that arises.

    module Life
      class Animal
          def self.eat
            puts 'Lets eat'
          end
      end
    end
    
    Life::Animal.eat

Use the `::` to indicate the class belongs to a specific module.
 
### Mixins

We can import blocks of code to our classes using Modules.

    module Life
      attr_accessor :name, :species
    
      def breathe
        puts 'Remember to breathe'
      end
    end
    
    class Animal
        include Life
    end
    
    cow = Animal.new
    cow.breathe

### Load, Require, Include

`load` uses relative and absolute paths to load in an external file.

`include` is only for bringing Modules in as mixins. It has NOTHING to do with files.

`require` is the same as load, but if you have already `required` a file once in the context, it will not load it in again. It keeps track of which files have been loaded, so that it doesn't duplicate the task.

If you want to refresh the code and bring something in a second time, use `load`, but usually you should just use `require`.
