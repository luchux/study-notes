# D3 V4

## SVG

SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphic. D3 makes use of the SVG shape library, which is defined and managed by the people who manage the HTML language.

You can't have a D3 graphic without an SVG container to put it in.

You can't put a div or table or paragraph inside an SVG, for example. It's not a normal HTML element. 

An SVG is a graphical element, and it can only contain graphical items, such as rectangles, lines, and circles. SVG can contain text too, but not within a paragraph element. 

D3 adds graphics and text to an SVG element and binds data to those elements. That is its entire job.

There are eight basic SVG predefined shape elements. They are `rectangle`, `circle`, `ellipse`, `line`, `polyline`, `polygon`, `path`, and `text`. D3 coders don't generally use `polygon` or `polyline`, because it's quicker to use `path`. 

## Adding SVG shapes to other SVG shapes

You cannot add text to a rectangle in D3. You can't add any SVG shape to another shape. What you'll have to do is add one element on top of adding another, and position them in a similar way.

The exception to this is `tspan` elements inside of a SVG `text` element, and `groups`, which use the HTML `g` tag.



## Raster vs Vector Images

There are two kinds of digital graphic, vector and raster, also called bitmap.

Raster graphics, such as photographs, reduce to tiny little blocks of color called pixels. A raster graphic that is 200 pixels wide by 100 high can't be made to 400 by 200 without losing definition. A vector graphic, by contrast, never loses definition. A vector graphic appears to you and me to be a shape, but behind the scenes, it is a mathematical definition.

## CSS with D3

A lot of CSS code that works on standard HTML does not apply to SVG elements.

For example, to create a border around a rectangle, we use stroke and stroke width instead of border as we would with the div. To color some text we use fill, not color. A lot of CSS knowledge can't be recycled when dealing with SVG.

Use external CSS where possible. Use `attr` where there is no alternative.

Some browsers, notably Firefox, require units to be added to some style declarations. When we come on to adding text, Firefox is quite happy to be given a font size attribute of 30, but if you give it a font size style of 30, it throws an error and ignores the command. You have to put px for pixels after the 30. So using style can be a bit fraught, because using attributes, which you can't avoid using in D3, and are far commoner than style declarations, you never have to really worry about units.

## Styling D3 Elements

You can style a D3 graphical element (e.g. a line) with `attr('stroke', 'blue')`, `style('stroke', 'green')` or in an external CSS stylesheet.

Extenal style sheets take precedence over `attr()`, but `style()` takes precedence over external style sheets, because it becomes an in-line style declaration.

## Select, Data, and Enter

    let oddNums = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
    let svg = d3.select('body').append('svg')
    svg.selectAll('rect')
        .data(oddNums)
        .enter()
            .append('rect')

`svg.selectAll('rect')` tells the browser to find the SVG element and have a look inside it for any rectangles. If it finds rectangles, it returns them in a selection, which is an array of elements. If it doesn't find any, it returns an empty selection, which is what's gonna happen in this case. 

`.data(oddNums)` binds data to a selection. It does this in order, so if the browser had found three rectangles, it would link the first rectangle to number 1, the second to number 3, the third one to 5, etc.

1, 3, and 5, are being used because `oddNums` is defined. What if the browser had found two elements? When joining data to elements, d3 puts any leftover data, or missing elements, into what's called an `enter` selection. This happens automatically and you can't see the `enter` selection here. If the browser had found two rectangles, this code would link number 1 to the first rectangle, number 3 to the second. It would then work out that it had a number 5, 7, and 9 waiting for a rectangle, and it would put those numbers (5, 7, 9) into an enter selection.

In our case, `selectAll` returns an empty selection, because there's no rectangles whatsoever within our SVG. This means d3 works out that all five data points are leftover, or missing elements, so it adds all five numbers to the enter selection.

The next line is `.enter().append("rect")`. We normally see `.enter()` followed by `.append()`, which is why I've put them on the same line. This line adds a rectangle for each item in the enter selection. In our case, that was five. Now what if our initial `selectAll` line had returned us six rectangles, but our data array still only had five items in it?

Then d3 would link the first five rectangles to the numbers and put the final rectangle into an `exit` selection. Instead of `.enter().append()` we could have `.exit().remove()`. In such a case, the `enter` selection would be empty, and running anything after `.append()` would have no effect at all.

D3 always seeks to balance the number of data points against the number of graphical elements. If there had been six rectangles within our SVG, the `exit` selection would contain the final rectangle, ready for removal. This data line binds data to graphical elements.

If there are more data points than there are rectangles, D3 will create rectangles. If there are more rectangles than there are data points, D3 will place the extra rectangles in the `exit` selection so that they can be removed.

## D3 SVG Required Attributes

All SVG elements, such as rectangles and circles, require a basic set of attributes. These differ by element. A circle, for example, must have x y coordinates and a radius or it simply will not appear on the page. For a rectangle, we need x, y, width and height as a minimum. We could also use rx and ry for rounded corners but we're not gonna use that now. Those attributes are optional.

## Giving Attributes Dynamic Values

    let oddsNums = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
    let svg = d3.select('body').append('svg')
    svg.selectAll('rect')
        .data(oddNums)
        .enter()
        .append('rect')
          .attr('height','200')
          .attr('width','50')
          .attr('x','20')
          .attr('y','100')

The above code will create several rectangles, but they'll all be stacked on top of each other, since each of them has an `x` val of `20` and a `y` val of `100`. We need the `x` and `y` vals to be dynamic, so we can place the rectangles in different places on the screen. We do that by setting their values to functions, which take `data` and an `index` as arguments. The `data` will equate to each data point in the array as it is looped over, and the `index` will equate to the index of that data point in the array on the current loop. 

So for a data array with 3 points [1, 3, 5], D3 will loop over it 3 times, with `data` being `1`, then `3`, then `5`, while `index` will be `0, 1, 2`.

By convention, we use `d` and `i` to represent `data` and `index`. So the above code could be rewritten with dynamic `x` positions as:

    let oddsNums = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
    let svg = d3.select('body').append('svg')
    svg.selectAll('rect')
        .data('dataArr')
        .enter()
        .append('rect')
          .attr('height','200')
          .attr('width','50')
          .attr('x', (d, i) => 60 * i)
          .attr('y','100')

Similarly, we could make each rect have a height that corresponds to the data in the array `oddNums`:

    .attr('height', (d, i) => d)

or if that was too small

    .attr('height', (d, i) => d * 15)

### Inverting the Y Coordinate

The `y` coordinate positions the topmost part of the rectangle vertically. Position of zero would be at the top of your screen here. Greater numbers move us downwards. The browser builds the page from top left to bottom right. But we read bar charts in the opposite way. We read them bottom up, assuming the numbers are positive. So what we need to do is invert the y position. We don't flip or rotate the bars, we just shift them downwards.

So let's say we want our x axis to be at a y position of 300. Here's how we'd perform the inversion.

    .attr('y', (d, i) => 300 - d)

## Paths

A path is a line, essentially. It can be wiggly, or straight, and it can be open, such as in a line chart, or closed, as in an area chart. Paths can be filled, and they can make unusual, irregular shapes.

Path takes one single attribute, D, or data. The data have to be presented in a particular way, as a string of x,y coordinates, separated by spaces.

The first letter here, M, means move to. Imagine sitting in front of a blank sheet of paper with a pencil. You put the pencil down at one location and draw a wiggly line. When the pencil hits the paper, before you've drawn anything, that is the first x,y coordinate. L means line to, in other words a straight line, so this line of code would draw us five straight line segments. You can add a z here, which closes the path for you. In other words, the browser will automatically add a straight line from the last set of x,y coordinates, back to the first.

You always begin with an M, with path data, but you can use different letters in place of the L. You could use C, for example, which means curve to. There are other options such as quadratic curves and elliptical arcs. All letters can be used in upper or lower case. Upper case means absolute positioning of X and Y, while lower case means relative positioning. To see the full list, visit the w3C site, or Google SVG paths. You might be relieved to know, that with D3 you rarely get your hands dirty with actually building a path statement.

We use generators to do that for us.

## Generators

D3 offers us various generators, which create familiar sounding shapes and charts. For example, there is an area generator which turns data into a wiggly shape running left to right closed off with vertical lines and a horizontal line to the bottom.

The area generator draws these extra lines for us automatically using path.

Here is an example of a `line generator`.

    let dataArr = [{x:5, y:5},{x:10, y:7},{x:15, y:9}, {x:20, y:11}]
    let line = d3.line()
                    .x(d => d.x * 10)
                    .y(d => d.y * 5)

The x and y values are dynamic and we're using functions to set their values.

This code generates a path element for us. And the path element is going to create what appears to us to be a line with three sections.

The magic of D3 will then take away those four coordinates and make us a line using `path`.

Now we can append this path with the following code:

    let svg = d3.select('#main').append('svg')
    svg.append('path')
        .attr('d', line(dataArr))

Conventionally we place generators towards the top of the code. The browser runs through a JavaScript file from top to bottom and we want it to know about the line generating function before we need to use it.

There is another benefit of using a D3 generator. Remember that a path data goes M followed by L or C to indicate line or curve. Well, D3 let's us do that with `curve`. E.g.

    let line = d3.line()
                    .x(() => d.x * 10)
                    .y(() => d.y * 5)
                    .curve(d3.curveStep)

We can also use `curveCardinal`. There are 18 types of curves. Check them out in the D3 API.

### Other Generators

D3 contains almost 20 generators in addition to `line`, including `area`, `arc`, `cord` and `symbol`. 

## Group Elements

Group elements don't show up on the web page themselves, you can't style them or put a border around them. 

But you can move them and rotate them which will move and rotate their contents, so they certainly have tangible effects. Groups allow you to join elements together, turn them all pink at the same time, or move them 50 pixels to the right at the same time. They also allow you to tidy up and organize elements in the DOM which can get into quite a mess.

## Scales and Axes

D3 will draw the axis line, the tick marks, and the labels dynamically from the data, spacing everything neatly for us.

D3 arranges all these elements in groups. If the data change, your axis updates. D3 axes can show dates, text, or numeric data.

### Scales

D3 scales can be `continuous`, `ordinal`, `quantized` or `sequential`.

So far we've supplied the raw data to D3, such as our `dataArray`, and then multiplied it by 15 or something, to make it the right sort of size on the web page. But we don't want to have to work out a multiplier every time we draw a chart. Scales will do this for us.

Scales have domains (aka inputs), and ranges (aka outputs).

Imagine you want to charge revenue, with a max of 10,000. The domain can accept negative values, even though it isn't here. So `0 - 10,000` is the domain of our scale, our input. Think of it line a number line, if you can remember those. Possible values run from left to right, from 0 to 10,000.

Most charts need two domains: one for the x-axis, and one for the y-axis. This looks like it's going to be y-axis data, to me, anyway, because the x-axis is usually dates. Next we have the range. Range is D3 speak for output. The range describes the height or width available for our chart on the web page, so the range is always in pixels. Range cannot be negative, because a negative height would be meaningless. As with domain, most charts would have two ranges: one for the x-axis, and one for the y.

As with the domain, the range can be thought of as a number line, running left to right.

All the scale does is works out the appropriate multiplier for our data. It's going to tell us that a revenue of 3,500 dollars should be plotted at a y value of 105 pixels, for a linear scale. To work out the multiplier, the scale needs four bits of information: the `minimum` and `maximum` values from our data, and the `starting` and `ending` pixel position where we want the chart.

One final thing: do you remember when we made our first bar chart? The bars were upside down to begin with. That's because web pages draw their elements top down, but we read charts bottom up, so we had to invert our y-position. For this reason, we normally match the minimum value of the domain against the maximum value of the range, and vice versa. It saves having to subtract y values from a height later.

### Scale Format

All type of scales are defined in the following manner:

    d3.scaleLinear().domain([min, max]).range([min, max])

Domain and Range always take an array. The array always has two values: `minimum` and `maximum`, in that order.

### Linear Scales

    let y = d3.scaleLinear()
                .domain([0, 1000])
                .range([height, 0])

Notice how `height` is set as the minimum, and 0 as the maximum? This is because when working with bar charts, we have to invert the Y-Axis, as we did above.

### Axis Generators using Linear Scales

The axis generator uses a scale to add and position elements on the page. The terminology has been hugely simplified in D3 v4. So all we do now is 

    let y = d3.scaleLinear()
                .domain([0, 1000])
                .range([height, 0])
    var yAxis = d3.axisLeft(y)

And that's it, we've declared a generator. Now the generator isn't going to run unless we call it, which we'll in a moment.

There are four types of axis in d3, `axisLeft`, `axisRight`, `axisTop`, `axisBottom`. And the `left` and the `right` part, just tells D3 where to put the labels relative to the line. Should the labels be placed on the left hand side of line or the right hand side of the line. And the same goes for top and bottom. So it's not about positioning the axis on the web page.

To add the axis, what we need to do is add a `group` element then call the axis on that `group`. D3 then adds all the elements into the `group` for us.

    svg.append('g').attr('class', 'y-axis').call(yAxis)

To move the axis, use `.attr('transform', 'translate(0,0)')`

    svg.append('g')
        .attr('class', 'y-axis')
        .attr('transform', 'translate(0,0)')
        .call(yAxis)

### Getting Charts to line up with Axes

There is a tried and tested method that makes lining up charts and axes easier. What we do is we declare a margin. And we declare it as an object.

    let margin = {left:50, right: 50, top: 50, bottom: 50}

So now in your code where you're positioning the chart and the axes, you can use:

    .attr('transform', `translate(${margin.left},${margin.top})`)

The most elegant way to move both chart AND axes is to create one group and but both the axis and the chart into that group.

### Specifying the number of ticks

    var yAxis = d3.axisLeft(y).ticks(3).tickPadding(10).tickSize(10)

`ticks` in the above code **SUGGESTS** the number of ticks that you'd like to see on the page, but D3 makes a smart decision about how many will actually look good for human eyes. You can force this number with `tickValues` if needed. `tickPadding` allows you to style the ticks. `tickSize` will change the size of the tick lines, but will not eat into the padding.

## Time Scales

    let years = ['2001','2002','2003','2004','2005']
    let x = d3.scaleTime().domain([min, max]).range([min, max]) 

For the domain, we want to get the minimum and maximum values of `years`, but these are currently strings. We need to convert them into dates before we can work with them. To do this, we use the D3 `timeParse` function.

    let parseDate = d3.timeParse("%Y")
    let maxYears = d3.max(years, d => parseDate(d))

`d3.max` will give you the maximum value from an array, and by combining it with `timeParse` as above you can change an array of string date values to `Date` objects and then use `d3.max` to find the latest date.

We could find the minimum array with `d3.min`, but there's another function called `extent` that outputs both a minumum and and maximum in an array for us. 

    let yearsRange = d3.extent(year, d => parseDate(d))
    // returns an [Date(2001), Date(2005)]

So we could rewrite our time scale as the following:

    let x = d3.scaleTime()
        .domain(d3.extent(years, d => parseDate(d)))
        .range([0, width]) 

## Document Order

Declare the height and the width, then work out the max and the min from your data, declare the scales using the max and min, and define the axis generators.

## Working with External Data

D3 has function to fetch and interpret CSV and JSON data.

    d3.csv().get()
    d3.json().get()

You can also scrape data from an external website with

    d3.html().get()
