# Flexbox

The basic premise of a flexbox is if you set the display property of a container to `flex` it will flex the size of all the containers within it. 

That means you can create things like equal height columns, layouts where the individual boxes within a flexbox will scale or contract individually, etc.

## Autoprefixer

The autoprefixer tool adds browser prefixes to your CSS code, ensuring a certain amount of compatability with older browsers.

## Display flex

Normally you'd have to take all the list items and either float them to the left or set them to display in line and then you would have to apply a bunch of other styling to get them to space out properly but because we're using Flexbox, the default setting for `display: flex;` is that all the items get aligned to the left and listed one after the other.

## Justify Content

`justify-content` allows you to specify how to horizontally justify the content

## Flex Wrap
`flex-wrap` allows you to specify that when there's not enough space for the items because of a narrow screen, start wrapping them down and maintaining their width.
