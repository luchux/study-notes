# Redux

## TLDR;

### Actions

Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. They are the only source of information for the store. You send them to the store using `store.dispatch()`. An action is simply a plain object that described *what happened*. E.g. Dave liked post 23571.

### Action Creators

Action creators are functions that return an action (hence creating them). 

### Reducers

Reducers specify how the application's state should change in response to an action. Reducers take the `previous state` and an `action` as params, and then uses those to create and return a `new state` (aka the next state). Reducers must stay pure - i.e. no side effects - calling it with the same inputs many times should produce the same output.

    (previousState, action) => newState

What not to do in reducers:

* Mutate its arguments;
* Perform side effects like API calls and routing transitions;
* Call non-pure functions, e.g. Date.now() or Math.random().


### Stores

The Store is the object that brings `reducers` and `actions` together. You only have a single store in a Redux app. It has the following responsibilities:

* Holds application state;
* Allows access to state via `getState()`;
* Allows state to be updated via `dispatch(action)`;
* Registers listeners via `subscribe(listener)`;
* Handles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by `subscribe(* listener)`

To create a store:

    let store = createStore(combinedReducers, [initialState])

### The Redux LifeCycle

#### 1. You call store.dispatch(action)

#### 2. The Redux store calls the reducer function you gave it.

The store will pass two arguments to the reducer: the current state tree and the action.

#### 3. The root reducer (combinedReducers) may combine the output of multiple reducers into a single state tree.

When you emit an action, combinedReducers will call all the reducers you listed with it. It will then combine all sets of results into a single state tree (e.g. a state object).

#### 4. The Redux store saves the complete state tree returned by the root reducer (combinedReducers).

This new tree is now the next state of your app! Every listener registered with `store.subscribe(listener)` will now be invoked; listeners may call `store.getState()` to get the current state.

Now, the UI can be updated to reflect the new state. If you use bindings like React Redux, this is the point at which `component.setState(newState)` is called.





## About Redux

Redux is an implementation of the Flux architectural pattern.

A big difference between Redux and Flux is that Redux only has one store. You cannot use multiple stores. 

Because there's only one store, there's no need for a dispatcher. The store will dispatch the actions directly.

Having one store means that all of your state will be located in one place - aka Single Source of Truth.

All the data for one client can be stored in a single object. Everything we need to know about the application is in this object. 

Storing everything in one place makes it much easier to work with the data in our application and track bugs. 

Some people might say that you lose modularity by storing everything in one object. In Redux, modularity is achieved by using functions.

## Functional Programming

The idea of using functions for modularity comes from the functional programming paradigm, which was used to develop Redux. 

### Pure Functions 

Pure functions are functions that don't cause side effects. Everything the function needs to operate are sent as arguments and a new result is returned.

Pure functions do not change any of their arguments or any global variables - they simply use the information to produce a new result.

### Immutability

To mutate is to change so to be immutable is to be unchangeable. We do not want to change the variables and objects in a functional application. Instead, we want to produce new ones. 

### Composition

Composition refers to the ability to put functions together so that one function's output becomes another function's input. This means that the values returned from one function become the arguments of the next functions until the last function returns the value we were looking for.

### Application of Functional Programming in Redux

In Redux, Composition is used in the store. The reducer functions that we create to manage parts of the state tree are composed, and the action and state is sent to and piped through each of these reducers until state is eventually mutated. 

## Application Planning

When wireframing, remember that you are using functional programming with Redux, so instead of listing the Objects needed (nouns e.g. View, Model, Collection, StudentModel, StudentsCollection), you should list the Actions (verbs e.g. add_user, remove_user).

### Planning Constants

List all of your action types as an object in `constants.js`.

    export const constants = {
        ADD_USER: "ADD_USER",
        REMOVE_USER: "REMOVE_USER",
        GRANT_ADMIN_PRIVS: "GRANT_ADMIN_PRIVS",
        REVOKE_ADMIN_PRIVS: "REVOKE_ADMIN_PRIVS"
    }

One of the reasons we use this paradigm is because if we just use the string value in our app, Javascript won't throw an error, but if we make a typo with the variable name, then Javascript **will** thrown an error.

### Planning State

Now that we've identified the actions, we want to identify the variables that those actions impact - our State. List the variables that will exist in your State.

### Initial State

You can create an initial State with a json file (e.g. `initialState.json`). It's designed to be a snapshot of our State at any given time.

    {
        'users': [
            {
                'name': 'Ben Grunfeld',
                'age': 36
            },
            {
                'name': 'John Malkovich',
                'age': 65
            }
        ],
        'workDays': 100,
        fetching: false,
        errors: []
    }


## Actions

Actions at bare minimum have a `type` field, but also usually a `payload`. The action should also contain any information to make the change.

    const action = {
        type: Constants.SET_GOAL,
        payload: 20
    }

## Reducers 

It's called a reducer because it's the type of function you would pass to `Array.prototype.reduce(reducer, ?initialValue)`.

Reducers are pure functions that are designed to manage specific parts of your `state` object. You need to create a reducer to manage every key in your `state` object. The reducer function **MUST BE** named with exactly the same name as the key of the `state` that the reducer is targeting.

Remember, we're not going to change the `state`, we're going to create a new `state` value, given the current `state`.

So a `reducer` is a function that will take `state` and an `action` to produce a new `state`. 

	export const spinner = (state=false, action) => 
		(action.type === C.ADD)?
		action.payload:
		state

We usually save the reducer files to the `store` directory. E.g. `reducers.js`.

You should always have a default for state, just in case it isn't added elsewhere. Also, Redux will throw you a warning if it isn't there.
 
## Composing Reducers

**Composing** means using the return value of one function as the argument for another function, which itself returns a value.

So if you have a reducer that adds a spinner boolean to indicate if the spinner should be turned on, and another reducer that *indicates* that a url fetch is in process from the server, the fetching reducer could also turn on the spinner by simply calling the spinner reducer. E.g.

	action = {
		type: C.ADD,
		payload: true
	}
	
	export const fetcher = (state=false, action) {
		(action.type === C.ADD)?
			spinner(true, action):
			state
	}

**This is called reducer composition, and it's the fundamental pattern of building Redux apps.**

I.e. the output of one reducer is used as the input for another reducer, and so on. 

Each reducer is in charge of managing its own part of the global state. The state parameter can be different for every reducer, and corresponds to only the part of the state that it is in charge of managing.

When the app is larger, we can split the reducers into separate files and keep them completely independent and managing different data domains.



## Combining Reducers

All `combineReducers()` does is generate a function that calls your reducers with the slices of state selected according to their keys, and combining their results into a single object again.

After installing Redux with `npm install --save redux`, we can use the `combinedReducers` method, which combines all of our reducers into a single function.

    import { combineReducers } from 'redux'
    
    export const target = (state=0, action) =>
        (action.type == Constants.SET_TARGET) ?
            parseInt(action.payload):
            state
	
    export const goal = (state=0, action) =>
        (action.type == Constants.SET_GOAL) ?
            parseInt(action.payload):
            state
    
    const appReducers = combineReducers({
        target,
        goal
    })
    
    export default appReducers

## The Store

### Store: Create Store

With Redux, we don't need to use our `appReducers` (above) to mutate the `state` because the store will manage the state for us. 

The `createStore` method is used to create instances of stores. 

At minimum, the `createStore` function takes as a param the reducer function used by the store.

The store holds state, and the store manages your state.

The store also takes `initialState` as a second argument. 

In Redux, the store is only there to manage state data. You can read state or mutate state, but the store should not contain any application logic. 

This means that your store and your reducers should not be involved in any of the following tasks:
	
	* generating unique ID's
	* reading or writing data to a persistence layer
	* mutating global state
	* changing global variables
	* fetching data from a rest endpoint or socket server via an AJAX request. 

Your application should **USE** the store. The store should not **BE** your application. The store simply contains the data. Your logic should go into Action Creators (below).

	const combinedReducers = combineReducers({
	  goal,
	  target
	})
	
	const initialState = {'goal': 10, 'target': 10}
	
	const store = createStore(combinedReducers, initialState)

### Store: Get State

We can always look at the state of the store by using the `getState()` method. 

	store.getState()

By using the `singleReducer` (combinedReducers), our default state will be set from all the default values we set in our reducers. So store will use the `singleReducer` (combinedReduers) to calculate the initial state.

### Store: The Dispatcher

The store also has a `dispatcher` that dispatches actions that mutate the `state`. The dispatch method expects an action object. An action object is just a regular object that has a `type` field, and optionally a `payload`.

You can call store.dispatch(action) from anywhere in your app, including components and XHR callbacks, or even at scheduled intervals.

### Store: The Subscribe Method

The store has a subscribe method that allows you to assign callback handlers that are invoked every time state changes. 

The subscribe method can be used to invoke callback handlers every time actions are dispatched.

	store.subscribe( () => console.log(store.getState()) )

The subscribe method will invoke the function once for every action that we dispatch. 

You can subscribe as many callback handlers as you like.

### Store: The Unsubscribe Method

The store also has an `unsubscribe` method that allows you to turn off store subscriptions. 

`store.subscribe()` returns a function that can be used to unsubscribe that particular method.

	const unsubscribeMethod = store.subscribe(() => {console.log(store.getState())})

## Middleware

Middleware allows us to add functionality directly to the store's dispatch pipeline. 

Middleware is far more powerful. Middleware gives us power over **how** actions are dispatched. We can add functionality *before* the action is dispatched, or *after* the action is dispatched. We can delay the dispatching of actions. We can even skip dispatching an action altogether. 

By comparison, `subscribe` allows us to subscribe listeners to the store, and these listeners are invoked *after* the dispatch occurs.

We're going to have to create a function that returns a function that returns a function.

Typically, this would be heavily nested, as follows, but with arrow functions, we can make this code look a lot nicer. We will be using the function with `next` as a parameter to invoke or dispatch the action. The function that the `next` function retuns contains the action that will be dispatched.

	const consoleMessages = function(store) {
		return function(next) {
			return function(action) {
				// old way of doing things ;)
			}
		}
	}

New way using arrow functions.

	const consoleMessages = (store) => (next) => (action) {
				// new way of doing things
	}

Because each of these take in only one argument, we don't even need the parens.

	const consoleMessages = store => next => action {
				// clean way of doing things
	}

This function gives us the action that is currently being dispatched, along with a mechanism to dispatch the action and change the state. We need to record the result.

	const consoleMessages = store => next => action => {
		let result
		result = next(action)
		return result
	}

The code `result = next(action)` is where the action is dispatched and where the state can be expected to change.

To make sure the state change gets registered, we must return the result.

So now we have a function that doesn't do much besides dispatching the action, and this makes sure we do not break the store's current dispatch pipeline. But inside of this function, we can add functionality before or after we dispatch the action. 

This middleware is reusable across stores across different applications. 

In order to apply this middleware with our store, we'll need to use the `applyMiddleware` 

Here is what it would lool like:

	applyMiddleware(consoleMessages)(createStore)(combinedReducers, initialState)

This will create stores with our consoleMessages middleware. It returns a store that's created with our middleware, and it also applies our combineReducers and any initial state that is passed to this function.


## Action Creators

Action creators are where all the logic of your applications goes. E.g. 

	* generating unique ID's
	* reading or writing data to a persistence layer
	* mutating global state
	* changing global variables
	* fetching data from a rest endpoint or socket server via an AJAX request. 

Action creators are just regular functions that create and return actions. They allow us to encapsulate the logic of our application using functions, not objects.

	export myAction = (arg1 = 5, arg2 = 10, arg3 = false) {
		// application logic here
		// play with your application variable values here
        
		return {
			type: 'ADD',
			payload: {arg1, arg2, arg3}
		}
	}


## Redux Thunk

Action creators are an ideal place to write your application logic, including requests to web servers. But our action creators often need to wait for a response from the web server before dispatching an action. 

Redux Thunk is middleware that we can add to our store. It allows us to build powerful action creators called thunks. Thunks are higher order functions that give you control over when and how often the actions are dispatched.

Thunks don't return the action object directly (like action creators) - they return a function. This function gets the store's `dispatch` method, AND the store's `getState` method as arguments. 

	export const randomGoals = () => (dispatch, getState) => { 
		dispatch({
			type: 'ADD',
			payload: 'something'
		})
	}

So from within this thunk I can dispatch actions. Additionally, I can call `dispatch` as often as I like from within a thunk, but I can also delay the dispatch.

So because thunks get the dispatch function, we have control over when and how often we are going to dispatch actions. Additionally, thunks get the `getState` method, so we could check the existing state before dispatching actions.

E.g. you could say check the app state to see if it is currently fetching something. If it is, do nothing, but if it isn't, then you can start dispatching actions to fetch data from the server.

You dispatch this `thunk` the same way you dispatch any other action creator. 

	store.dispatch(
		randomGoals()
	)


## Fetching from the Server with Isomorphic-Fetch

Isomorphic fetch is an implementation of the whatwg fetch specification that works both in Node JS and in the browser. We use this method to fetch URL's.

	npm install --save isomorphic-fetch es6-promise

then

	import fetch from isomorphic-fetch

The isomorphic `fetch` library returns a promise. That means that we can wait for an asynchronous response. Using a `then` function, we can wire up a handler that will handle the response when it occurs. So when we get a response, that response will be passed back to us in a call back function sent to the `then` function.

	export const queryUserData = value => dispatch => {
		
		dispatch({
			type: C.FETCH_USER_DATA
		})	
	
		fetch('http://getuserdata.com/user' + user_id)
			.then(response => response.json())
			.then(resultAsJson => {
	
				dispatch({
					type: C.DISPLAY_USER,
					payload: resultAsJson
				})
			})
			.catch(error => {
				
				dispatch(
					addError(error.message)
				)
	
				dispatch({
					type: C.CANCEL_FETCHING
				})
			})
	}

The above `then` functions pass themselves return the result and pass it as an argument to the next `then` function.

## React-Redux Library

`react-redux` is a library that you can import through NPM.

### The Provider

It makes a component called the `Provider` available, which can be wrapped around any component tree, and it will place the `store` in context. That way, any child react component will be able to interact with the `store`.

	ReactDOM.render(
		<Provider store={store}>
			<div></div>
		</Provider>,
		document.getElementById('main')
	)

### Connect

`connect` is a function from the `react-redux` library.

    const Container = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(UIComponent)

`connect` grabs the `state` out of `store`, which was made available by the `Provider`, and maps whatever you specify from `state` to properties. 

It then supplies these props to the component that it is wrapping around (in the above example: `UIComponent`) and then returns a new component (in the above example: `Container`) which is a copy of `UIComponent` that has been hydrated with the props from `mapStateToProps`.

**Mapping props to React components**

	import { connect } from 'react-redux'
	
	const mapStateToProps = (state, props) => {
		return {
			goal: state.goal.value
			target: state.target.value
		}
	}
	
	const Container = connect(mapStateToProps)(UIComponent)

This will take our `mapStateToProps` function and actually map the values that we've saved under `goal` and `target` to the properties of the UIComponent, `goal` and `target`. The second argument, `props` are any props that were passed to the component by the Parent.

**Mapping dispatch to React components**

`mapDispatchToProps` allows us to give our React components the ability to dispatch actions in a Redux app. I.e. it gives our components controlled access to `store.dispatch(action)`.

`mapDispatchToProps` receives the store's `dispatch` function as an argument.



    import { connect } from 'react-redux'
    
    const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
        return {
            onClearError(index){
                clearError(index)
            }
        }
    }
    
    const Container = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(UIComponent)

Inside your React code, you can then call it with the following:

    const handleError = error => {
        store.dispatch(
            addError(error.message)
        )
    }
    
    <Component onClick={handleError} />

#### Container Components vs Presentational Components

Presentational components are regular React components that describe what something will look like, not how it will function. They communicate solely through `props`. They pass data up to their parents with 2 way data binding and receive props as well. 

Containers wrap around a presentational component and feed data to it.

Technically, a container component is just a React component that uses `store.subscribe()` to read a part of the Redux state tree and supply props to a presentational component it renders. You could write a container component by hand, but we suggest instead generating container components with the React Redux library's `connect()` function, which provides many useful optimizations to prevent unnecessary re-renders. (One result of this is that you shouldn't have to worry about the React performance suggestion of implementing `shouldComponentUpdate` yourself.) 

To use connect(), you need to define a special function called mapStateToProps that tells how to transform the current Redux store state into the props you want to pass to a presentational component you are wrapping.

In addition to reading the state, container components can dispatch actions.

In a similar fashion, you can define a function called mapDispatchToProps() that receives the dispatch() method and returns callback props that you want to inject into the presentational component.

    const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
      return {
        onTodoClick: (id) => {
          dispatch(toggleTodo(id))
        }
      }
    }

In case you are worried about mapStateToProps creating new objects too often, you might want to learn about computing derived data with reselect. (check docs)
